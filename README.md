Knowledge Graph Database: Ontotext GraphDB

Currently, we are using a free version of the GraphDB. Therfore, it's not hosted on the server.

To update the data in the knowledge graph, you need to export a Turtle file of a graph.

## Dependencies
1. [rdf4j](https://rdf4j.org/documentation/) library (3.7.3) to add or delete data from the database.
2. [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) as a build and dependency management tool.
    - Maven works really well with [Intellij](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/). So, I recommend to use Intellij for your IDE.
